### üìõ Why is the Logo Blurred?

The blurred logo in this portfolio belongs to an early design phase of the project. It features a "ravage gamer mascot" that was generated using an online app/tool during initial brainstorming. 

However, since the source and license of this image are unclear, I cannot confirm whether it is free for commercial or public use. To avoid any potential copyright infringement, I have intentionally blurred the logo for this showcase.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: I do not claim ownership of the original image used in the logo and do not support or encourage any unauthorized use of copyrighted materials.

Thank you for understanding.
